- 👋 Hi, I’m Cezar from São Paulo, Brazil
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about DevOps culture and your applicability
- 🌱 I’m currently following a path to learn the fundamentals of: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Docker, Jenkins, some Lean Strategies, IaC, CI/CD, Elastick Stack, Nagios, Graphite and Grafana and Kubernets
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can help as a beginner in the "DevOps culture" although I have 15+ years of experience in IT Infrastructure (using ITIL) 
- 📫 How to reach me cezar.reigada@outlook.com
