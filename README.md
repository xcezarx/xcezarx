- 👋 Hi, I’m Cezar from São Paulo/Brazil and I have over 15 years of experience in IT. I built most of my career in the Backup and Storage areas. Infrastructure and Data Protection are in my veins.  

- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about DevOps culture and your applicability. Mixing my experience in ITIL together with the Lean/Agile culture aiming the perfect balance for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery.

- 🌱 I’m currently following a path to learn the fundamentals of: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Docker, Jenkins, some Lean Strategies, IaC, CI/CD, Elastick Stack, Nagios, Graphite and Grafana and Kubernets

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can help as a beginner into the “DevOps culture” 

- 📫 How to reach me? drop me an email in cezar.reigada@outlook.com
